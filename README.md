## 📱 Mobile-First "Pro" Architecture

The platform adapts into a high-end mobile application on smaller screens:

*   **Horizon Glimpses Carousel**: Replaces the discovery rail with a horizontal, cinematic Reels carousel at the top of the feed.
*   **Professional Bottom HUD**: A floating glassmorphic navigation bar with professional SVG icons and identity previews.
*   **Touch-Optimized Tabs**: Elastic scrolling tab bars for effortless swiping through content categories.
*   **Adaptive Padding**: Custom logic to ensure content never clashes with the floating navigation elements.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy & UX

*   **Professional Aesthetic**: Moved away from generic emojis to customized, professional SVG iconography for the entire interface.
*   **Interactive Authority**: Every creator name and avatar is a portal, linking directly to their `/creator/[name]` identity with smooth transition animations.
*   **Cinematic Motion**: "Light-sweep" effects, "Ken Burns" breathing on cards, and thermal pulsing on heat metrics.
*   **Typography**: Tabular numerals for data accuracy, wide-track uppercase for command headers, and elegant italics for "Premium" flair.
